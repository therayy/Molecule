To write the molecule.yml file you need to get the [image-info](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) you will be using.

Make sure that your creating the files under that path molecule/default then Run the following command to start testing:
```
molecule test
```
    Note: If you got this error:
         ```    
         ERROR: Failed to pre-validate. {'driver': [{'name': ['unallowed value docker']}]}
         ```
### Therefore you need to install molecule-docker package.

```
pip3 install molecule-docker
```

Create the docker containers _(make sure you are one step back from the molecule directory )_

```
bash
cd ../../
molecule create
```

### Step 3

Run the converge playbook file on both containers:

```bash
molecule converge
```

### Step 4

When you are done and would like to remove the containers:

```
bash
molecule destroy
```

### Get inside the containers

Use the following command to see the created machine names:

```
bash
molecule login
```

Use the following command to get inside the container:

```
bash
molecule login -h <machine-name>
```

### For Testing

You can run this to test creating > running converge > and destroy all at once:

```
bash
molecule test
```
